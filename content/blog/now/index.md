### **Fantasy Sports**
Currently in 3 money leagues in Yahoo Fantasy Bball. All projected to make the fantasy playoffs and all projected to greatly disappoint me in the playoffs.

### **Games**
Currently playing Slay the Spire, a difficult deck-building roguelite game, and BioShock Infinite, a single player FPS adventure. Having a blast with both. Contemplating on trying XCOM 2 (got through PS+ membership), Sims 4 (also through PS+ membership). Never tried either franchise before but its free so...

### **Shows**
Currently watching reruns of Bob's Burgers, Community and Brooklyn 99. Occasionally will tune into random anime (No Game No Life on Netflix, Vinland Saga on Amazon Prime)

### **Looking Forward To**
- hanging out with my cat and my wife on quiet nights and weekends
- some calm mindset and time so that I can get through the catalog of books I got saved on my Kindle
- the next cold front (hoping for some more sweater weather)

### **Not Looking Forward To**
- tax season -_-
- pollen season (somehow started early here in Florida)
- after winter Florida heatwave
