### **Career**

- In between Jobs at the moment, if you are looking for a software engineer that leans a bit more towards the front-end, look no further, here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/192QaD_l49ZpSutkKreKkAYp6R6qPlDzN/view?usp=sharing)
- Working on this blog of [mine](https://www.vietnguyen.site)
- Want to get more into Game Development with Javascript or Python. I got ideas I want to make!
- Currently looking for remote part-time contracts to supplement income, if you need any Front-end JS/TS work, I am your [person](mailto:vtn1989@gmail.com?subject=Part%20Time%20Work%20Inquiry)!

### **Music**
Listening to 
- any Lofi Hip Hop Channel on YouTube
- Trap/Phonk/Vaporwave live channels on Youtube
- JPEGMafia & Danny Brown - Scaring the Hoes Vol.1
- Across the Spiderverse soundtrack

### **Games**
In the midst of my sudden career change, I (on a whim) bought and beat Diablo 4 in 4 days with my wife. Current class is twisted blades rouge and will try and run a druid for S1.

### **Shows**
Bro's hulu account got deactivated so no more Bob's Burgers or The Great North (i miss them) but did binge a bunch of anime before the activation. Currently waiting for JJK S2 to finish so I can binge it. Also heard good things about Zom 100 so may take a look into that as well. Once I have the urge I was also be finishing up the Witcher S3 on Netflix.

### **Looking Forward To**
- Japan/Korea in Q4
- getting a new J-O-B, the hunt is a grind
- S1 of Diablo 4
- Cooler weather. Summers in Florida hurt

### **Not Looking Forward To**
- Summer rains, they are already here
- Inevitable tech interviews and whiteboarding. I mucho hate these!
