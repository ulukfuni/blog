Slowly going thru Borderlands 4. Very slowly. Bringing open world-ness to the borderlands universe has been real nice.

### **Shows**
Still watching Bob's Burger as background noise. Have yet to pick up anything new. Sort of fallen off watching things and keeping up with shows.

### **Health** (new)
This actually requires a separate post but health wise everything is stable but I really do need to write an update on this because its been a journey.

### **Outlook**
- Since last updated in 2023, AI has taken over alot of my interest. I feel like its still early days but AI has unlocked alot for me in terms of learning, building, doing, etc.
- Real bullish on AI
- Also since last update in 2023, I have really honed in on improving my health with supplements, changing diet and trying to optimize sleep. Super bullish on doing these to further improve my life.

### **Looking Forward To**
- Japan/Korea in Q4 (funnily enough this was also in my last NOW update)
- overall vacationing
- relieving some burnout

### **Not Looking Forward To**
- packing
- cleaning
- travel prep
- leaving my cats
