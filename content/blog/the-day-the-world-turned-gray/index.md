Decemeber 6th, 2023.

I will remember this day vividly.

I woke up. It felt like any other day and I started with a look at my phone. 

She was in the ICU, my phone said. She was admitted the day before. Big medical terms that painted a bleak picture. My heart sank.

My sister asked if I wanted to drive with her to South Florida to be with her in the hospital.

I had to wait for the handymen that was going to fix something on the roof and it really needed to be done before the big Asia trip. I got a call that they were delayed until the afternoon. So I had to wait. My heart raced with anxiety.

I was also juggling work and also speaking with a recruiter about a new role, a role I was ready to accept but had to iron a few details out.

I was pacing around the house. My heart was in my throat and also in my stomach. It was agony. Time went so slow. And I had to wait it out. More updates came and went. She had stabilized. I let out a yell of encouragement in the air. The handymen came and fixed things up rather quickly. Great. I met up with my future boss and ironed out the final details. I accepted the offer right there and then. Excellent. Things were turning around.

Once I got off the call, I called my dad and started driving towards Daytona to pick him up since he was using my old car to go to work and that car would not survive the 4 hr drive to South Florida.

Tina prepared an overnight bag for me and had to stay behind for the cats. I had an hour drive ahead of me to pick up my dad. So I went. That was a long hour of uncertainty but I got to my parent's house. No updates so far so I thought we were in the clear.

My dad had just got off work so he had to pack some stuff up. I waited around the house. I hadn't eaten all day so I had a bag of chips and some water. What was this feeling I was feeling? There were still no updates in a while.

My dad said he had a bad feeling since no updates. I didn't want to hear that so I waited in the car to leave.

Now we are all packed up and started driving. Still no updates. I was in the driver seat. My dad asked for an update in the family group chat. I now wish he didn't.

"She go in peace" was my mom's reply back.

I was in the driver's seat but I felt directionless. I felt hopeless. Sadness filled to the brim. I concentrated on the road with wet eyes. My heart was back in my throat. I gripped the wheel. The sun was bright but it was grey out. The roads were empty. We drove in silence for a long while.

// lots of phone calls to my dad about her passing. didnt enjoy those as they sounded so insincere

// driver switch to get gas, i was able to text and catch up on texts

// drove all the way to pick up kenny from airport, he had interrupted his dallas work trip to fly to south florida

// drove to the house where all the family had gathered.

I knew this was the hardest part. I just didn't know how to handle it all.

In Buddhism and maybe in general, there is a lot of talk about energy and its manifestation in feelings and in people. The energy in the house when we arrived was absolutely grey. First person I saw was her oldest sister and she bawled when she saw us. All her young nieces and nephews were gathered on the couch, somber looks on their faces. I really can't put into words all the feelings in that house that night but this was the part I finally felt it. She was gone.

My heart was already broken into pieces but it further broke being in that house that night.
