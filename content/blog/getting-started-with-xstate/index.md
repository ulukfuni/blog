> TL;DR State machines are an interesting topic that I have no been properly introduced to even though I probably, unintentionally use it in alot of my programming tasks. I am still a bit inexperienced with modeling my UI to a state machine but I hope [these](https://css-tricks.com/using-react-and-xstate-to-build-a-sign-in-form/) [links](https://css-tricks.com/robust-react-user-interfaces-with-finite-state-machines/) [that](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) I used will help you in using state machines in JS.
